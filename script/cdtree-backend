=head1 SYNOPSIS

To use in shell:

 % cdtree() { cd `cdtree-backend "$1"`; }

Take a look at this example filesystem layout:

 media/
   mv/
     en/
       a/
         acdc/
         ...
       b/
         bruno-mars/
         ...
       c/
         carly-rae-japsen/
         celine-dion/
         charlie-puth/
         ...
       d/
         demi-lovato/
         dido/
         ...
     fr/

       c/
         celine-dion/
         ...
       ...
     ...
  ...

Searching descendants, depth-first:

 % cd /media/mv
 % DEBUG=1 cdtree celine-dion
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/a
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/a/acdc
 ...
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/b
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/b/bruno-mars
 ...
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/c
 cdtree: Found      /media/mv/en/c/celine-dion

Searching siblings:

 % cd /media/mv/en/c/celine-dion
 % DEBUG=1 cdtree charlie-puth
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/c
 cdtree: Found      /media/mv/en/c/charlie-puth

Searching parent's siblings:

 % cd /media/mv/en/c/celine-dion
 % DEBUG=1 cdtree evanescence
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/c
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/c/carly-rae-japsen

 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/d/demi-lovato
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/d/dido
 ...
 cdtree: Looking in /media/mv/en/e
 cdtree: Found      /media/mv/en/e/evanescence


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<cdtree> is a command to change directory by searching your argument in
descendants (depth-first), then siblings (depth-first), then parent's siblings
(depth-first), and so on until it tries the root's siblings. It stops after it
finds the directory. It can take a while(!) but it's convenient.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG => bool

If set to true, will print the directories as they are tried.


=head1 TODO

Timeouts/limits: number of seconds, number of directories searched.
